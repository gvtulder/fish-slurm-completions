# SLURM completions for the fish shell

These files provide [fish](https://fishshell.com/) completions for the `sbatch`, `scancel`, `squeue` and `scontrol` utilities of the [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) cluster management software.

The completions are aimed at cluster users: they provide autocomplete suggestions for job IDs and job names, among other things, but do not cover all of the administrative SLURM utilities.

## Installation

Copy the `completions/` and `functions/` folders to your `~/.config/fish/` directory.
